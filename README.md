# Pipeline for dampened Ly-Î± detection and column density measurement

[ref]

This code utilizes convolutional neural network models to classify, locate, and measure Dampened Lymann Alpha emission lines in SDSS3 sightlines found in the DR9 and DR12 catalogs.

Full catalogs will be provided in the future.

Current use of the code is demonstrated in the Jupyter notebooks (python 2.7). Pre-trained models are provided in the source here under /models.

The current state of this code is a fully working beta v0.1. Further documentation will be added when the final papers are published and features are added and tuned.
