DR7 Summary:

There are 3 main points to summarize from a comparison of our
ML results on the DR7 versus the DLAs published by Notredaeme2009:

I.  Comparing DLAs in N09 vs. ML

  Of the 937 DLAs published in N09, our ML algorithm reported 777
as DLAs and 45 as LLS (within a tolerance of 0.015 in redshift).
That leaves ~100 cases where we didn't report
anything.  Most of these have low NHI and may or may not be DLAs
(see the figure).  I've inspected most of the ones with higher NHI.
There are a ~3 where our algorithm failed and our PDF output
shows no obvious reason.  The others are bogus or highly debatable, i.e.
N09 includes many non-DLAs.

I also attach a figure comparing the redshifts and NHI values
for the 784 DLAs in common.  The results are sensible.  I'll
add that the confidence values for the ML DLAs are nearly all
very high for these 784.

II. DLAs in ML but not in N09 (or my DR5 sample)

There are ~6500 DLA candidates from the ML that are not
in the N09 sample (nor my DR5 catalog, mainly).  These
have a sensible distribution of absorption and redshift.
I've looked at ~100 of them and they fall into 3 categories:

  A.  BALs -- You can almost pick these out as they tend to occur
  several to the sightline and with low confidence values.
  B.  Lower S/N data but good DLAs -- These have high confidence
  values and are simply in spectra that N09 nor my DR5 sample
  considered carefully.
  C.  Lower confidence candidates -- Many of these are 'dodgy'
  either due to low S/N or weak DLA absorption.

Anyhow, I expect there are over 1000 new, bona-fide DLAs
in this sample.


III.  Confidence

I'm not clear on how strongly we valued the confidence parameter
generated by the code, but I'm now convinced it is a very valuable
metric.  Basically, I think the purity of the DLA sample is very
high for confidence > 0.9 (maybe 0.7) and likely poor for values
of <0.5 (many are BALs).   We should give some greater emphasis
to this point in the paper.
