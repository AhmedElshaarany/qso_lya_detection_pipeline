Notes on spot-checking a few misses, i.e. in Notredaeme but not in ML

* J094118.18+140827.85    21.12 2.255  2580   612
  * Possible DLA but nowhere near 21.12
  * ML yielded nothing
* J101849.40+161428.26     20.7 2.524  2589   203
  * Looks like a solid DLA; not sure about 20.7 though
  * Strong SiII 1526
  * ML yielded 20.22 [could be]
* J103035.66+445033.47    21.37 2.749  1431   358
  * Very strong proximate DLA
  * ML yielded nothing
* J104002.02+314149.91    20.57 2.872  2019   194
  * Another not too far from Lya
* J113243.73+093152.31    21.42 3.887  1223    26
  * DLA redshift is offset by 0.03
* J114317.14+142431.04    20.83 3.536  1761   262
  * Notredaeme is junk!
* J124701.19+222842.51    20.79 3.505  2648   120
  * ML claims subdla at z=3.498
  * Both find DLA at z=3.624
* J133042.52-011927.55    21.19  2.88   910   526
  * MISSED BADLY -- NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS ONE
  * DR5 ignored it too.  Why?!
  * No metals
  * Was this sightline in the training sample??
* J140243.97+590959.07    21.31 3.806   787    48
  * A lot of flux in that core
  * No metals
  * Could well be bogus
  * BOSS spectrum is strongly over-absorbed
  * Still no metal lines..
  * z=3.806 ruled out by Lyb;  DR5 was 3.779
  * Lyb prefers 3.7237 but nothing at Lyg
* J145403.78+402603.22    20.85 2.817  1397    63
  * Flux at Lya; DLA looks dodgy
  * Picked out in DR5 by JXP but no metals
  * BAL-type in BOSS spectrum (broad SiIV, CIV)??
* J155442.53+045520.62    20.89 3.587  1822   235
  * Junk;  5575A but depressed flux around it
* J205509.49-071748.62    21.36 3.553   636   135
  * ML missed it altogether!
  * Possible Lya emission?
  * Not in DR5 either??
* J211805.16+010758.03    20.87 3.309   986   625
  * Lots of flux at supposed core;  looks very dodgy
  * No metals

Examining systems detected in ML but not in PN

* 266, 48 
  * Strange zero flux error in spectrum
  * Should investigate
* BALs abound
* 277, 363
  * DLA at z=3.236 is Lyb for z=4.036
* 278, 215
  * Low S/N;  likely false positives
* 283, 315
  * BAL
* 286, 598
  * BAL
* 290, 436
  * Low S/N, high z qso
  * Bunch of dodgy systems
  * All have low confidence
* 302, 438
  * BAL
* 310, 241
  * BAL
* 335, 265
  * Looks legit to me;  Not in DR5 either..
* 345, 537
  * Looks legit to me;  Not in DR5 either..
* 346, 595
  * BAL?  Likely
* 359, 441
  * Right on edge of spectrum; looks legit
  * Low S/N
* 364, 240
  * Low S/N, but legit;  *strong* metal lines
* 367, 436
  * BAL
* 418, 452
  * Legit DLA
  * In DR5
* 430, 43
  * Low S/N but rather compelling
* 442, 508
  * Lower S/N but strong metals; solid DLA
  * Why is this not in PN???
* 449, 246
  * Low S/N;  probably a BAL too
* 455, 344
  * Low S/N but definite DLA; strong metals
* 686, 561
  * Likely blend but also likely DLA
  * Not in DR5
  * Lower z DLA is Lyb/OVI [and was considered such]
* 690, 590
  * Looks solid
* 784, 246
  * NV BAL
* 786, 310  [two conf=1. systems]
  * Lower z DLA has strong metals
  * Higher z looks reasonable
* 789, 254  
  * Very compelling
  * Low S/N but extremely strong metals
* 795, 3 (conf=0.987)
  * S/N=1;  not compelling
* 827, 534
  * Bad NHI
  * But very strong metals at that redshift
* 836, 68
  * Looks solid
* 859, 349 -- High NHI with lower confidence
  * Such a high NHI does seem improbable
* 861, 330 -- Another high NHI with lower confidence (0.825)
  * Looks solid;  metals included
  * But S/N is low
* 904, 552 (low NHI at high confidence)
  * Plausible
* 909, 127 -- modest NHI, high confidence
  * Solid
* 913, 115
  * Solid, strong metals
  * Why isn't this in PN?!!
* 1200, 115
  * High confidence is solid; lower is not
* 1206, 111
  * High confidence is solid; lower is not
* 1212, 213 -- pair of systems near conf=1
  * BAL
* 1218, 90
  * High conf is solid
* 1232, 483
  * High conf is solid
* 1240, 256
  * High conf is solid but NHI is poor
