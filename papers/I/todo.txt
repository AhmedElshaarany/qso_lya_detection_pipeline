    1)  Understand 910, 526  z=2.88; NHI=21.19
        -- Was it in our training set as a non-sightline?
        -- Yes, it was!!
2)  Highlight J1402+5909
    3)  How are Lyb being dealt with?  Just fine
4)  What is the cut on confidence?
  -- Plot confidence for NHI and zabs
5) Generate S/N vs. NHI vs. confidence plot [JXP]
6) Compare outputs in DR7 vs. DR12
7) Confidence of good DR5 and false positives/negatives
8) Generate DLA tables;  add BAL flags [JXP]

--- Paper Edits ---

i. jxp@ucsc.edu -> xavier@ucolick.org
ii. Improve Intro [JXP]
iii. Move brief discussion of Training up sooner
iv. Need to comment that SDSS pixel is 70 km/s and our CNN
  would likely need to be re-trained on data with a different sampling
v. Fig 1 -- Too complex; fig caption is confusing
vi. Do we average the log NHI or NHI values (must be the former)
    vii.  NNA section (p.5) is a good descripton.  Move up
    viii.  Add more text on injecting DLAs
    ix.  Is a DLA match dz = 0.03 or +/- 0.015 ?  Let's use 0.03
x.  Better wording for the '83 additional DLAs'
xi.  What does 'these failure cases tend to the extreme' mean?
    xii. What are the false positives in DR5?
xiii.  Need to be quantitative in "Quantifying uncertainty" section
    ix. Move Sec 5 to Sec 2
x. Explain why the search starts at 900A
xi. DR12 [JXP]
xii. Hyper-parameter search (Appendix) [David]
xiii. Comment on 278, 208 in DR7 but not in N09 [one of 1804; show fig?; JXP]

--- Figure Edits ---

Fig 3:
  a.  Do not show rest-frame wavelengths
  b.  Stck to touch
  c.  Avoid green shading
  d.  Get sightline from David

Fig 4:
  a. Remove green dots
  b. Zoom in y better (all panels)

Fig 5:
  a. Get sightlines from David
  b. Improve fig caption
  c. How do the z and NHI compare for the recovered DLA?
    And what was its confidence?
  d. These are not *extremely* low S/N data

Fig 6:
  a. Get DLAs
  b. Improve the continuum of the profiles

Fig 7:
  a. Get DLAs
  b. Fuss with continua

Fig 8:
  a. Data and/or Notebook

Fig 9:
  a. Notebook

Fig 10:
  a. Isn't this mainly a repeat of earlier figure?
  b. Lower sightline is not that low S/N

Fig 11:
  a.  Looks crummy;  what is the confidence?

Fig 12:
  a.  Get the data

--- Table Edits ---

False negatives in Training
  a. Reword 'Low redshift'

False negatives in DR5
  a.  What do 'errors' mean??
